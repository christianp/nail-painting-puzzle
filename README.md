# Katie's nail-painting puzzle

A game based on [Katie Steckles's binary nail-painting puzzle](http://aperiodical.com/2016/05/katies-binary-nails-tutorial-and-a-puzzle/). 
The aim is to add or remove varnish from your nails in a sequence such that every combination of painted/unpainted appears on your hand once, while minimising the number of times you remove paint from a finger (acetone isn't free).

Drag rows of the sequence to reorder them.
Your best score is shown in red; click it to restore the sequence that made that score.
